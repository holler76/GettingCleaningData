SubjectId:                               Element 1    Max Length: 2
  Identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
  The value is extracted from the subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt files

ActivityName:                            Element 2    Max Length: 18
  The name of the activity being performed by the subject for which the sample measurements were taken.
  The value is derived using the 'class label' held in the activity_labels.txt file to map to the value held in the y_train.txt and y_test.txt files (which in turn is mapped to the observations held in the x_test.txt and x_train.txt files)
